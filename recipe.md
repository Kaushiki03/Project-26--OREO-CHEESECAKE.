***_RECIPE OF OREO CHEESECAKE_***

To get started with this Oreo Cheesecake, you’ll make the crust. I used my trusty Oreo Cookie Crust Recipe, which uses the full Oreo. No need to remove the cream filling – it all goes in there. So just combine the Oreo crumbs with some melted butter and press it into your springform pan. Then you’ll bake the crust for about 8 to 10 minutes and set it aside while you make the filling.

The filling is basically my Classic Cheesecake filling, but with a couple additions. It uses both Oreo crumbs and chopped Oreos, making this not just a vanilla cheesecake with some Oreos in it, but a true Oreo Cheesecake.

First, you’ll want to combine the cream cheese, sugar and flour and mix it all together until it’s well combined and smooth. Be sure to mix on a low speed, since using a high speed adds air to the batter. The air bubbles can rise to the top and create cracks in your finished cheesecake.

After that you’ll add your sour cream, which adds that classic cheesecake tang, and vanilla extract. Then the eggs are added one at a time, mixing until combined after each.

The final step to making the filling is to stir in the Oreo crumbs, which naturally add tasty flavor.
